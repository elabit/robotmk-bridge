This project builds upon the outstanding work of the **Oxygen** project. 

Oxygen tool was developed originally by Eficode Oy as part of [Testomat project](https://www.testomatproject.eu/) with funding by [Business Finland](https://www.businessfinland.fi/).

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to the original authors all contributors of Oxygen for creating this openly licensed foundation.  
Their work has made it possible for us to explore new directions with the Robotmk Bridge and to extend its capabilities for synthetic monitoring use cases.

Initially, we considered contributing directly to the original Oxygen project.  
However, for the purposes of long-term maintenance, integration stability, and independent release cycles, we decided that maintaining our own repo would be more sustainable. 
Depending on an external upstream (Eficode) for critical pull requests and feature merges was seen as a potential risk in the context of the Robotmk Bridge's product roadmap and release cadence.

So, while the Robotmk Bridge introduces new features and architectural elements, its roots in Oxygen remain a key inspiration.  
All credit for the original ideas, structure, and early design belongs to the Oxygen project and its maintainers.
